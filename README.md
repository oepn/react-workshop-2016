# _Intro to React_ Sample Projects

Resources for the [Intro to React](http://www.meetup.com/Dev-Workshop-Indy/events/229784684/) workshop.

## Usage

For `/1-simple`, just open `index.html` or `example.html` directly in a browser.

For `/2-jspm` or `/3-webpack`, run this inside their directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a server on <http://localhost:3000> that reloads as you make changes.

## Troubleshooting

If `npm install` fails, delete `npm-shrinkwrap.json` and try running it again.
